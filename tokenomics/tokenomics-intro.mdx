## Introduction to QuantPilot's tokenomics

**QuantPilot (ticker: $QP) serves as the fundamental currency across our entire ecosystem, enabling access to our applications and services. Whether you're accessing premium features, paying usage fees, or subscribing to specialized tools, $QP is the monetary unit that ensures a seamless user experience. Our core objective is to create sustainable, real demand for $QP by swapping platform fees into $QP and then burning the acquired $QP tokens. This mechanism not only secures the token's utility but also consistently reduces its circulating supply, ultimately benefiting token holders and strengthening the value of the entire ecosystem.**

### No Inflation

All tokens are minted at launch, with no future minting.

### Fee-Driven Buy + Burn

Every time a fee is paid, the fee is used to buy $QP from the open decentralized market to then immediately burn it.

### Deflationary Supply

Over time, constant burning reduces the total circulating supply.
