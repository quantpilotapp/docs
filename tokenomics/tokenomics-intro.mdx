<Warning>QuantPilot has not yet launched its token. The token launch is planned for Q1 2025.</Warning>

## Introduction to QuantPilot's tokenomics

Token serves as the fundamental currency across our entire ecosystem, enabling access to our applications and services. Whether you are accessing premium features, paying usage fees, or subscribing to specialized tools, our token is the monetary unit that ensures a seamless user experience. Our core objective is to create sustainable, real demand for our token by swapping platform fees into our token and then burning the acquired tokens. This mechanism not only secures the token's utility but also consistently reduces its circulating supply, ultimately benefiting token holders and strengthening the value of the entire ecosystem.

### No Inflation

All tokens are minted at launch, with no future minting.

### Fee-Driven Buy + Burn

Every time a fee is paid, the fee is used to buy our token from the open decentralized market to then immediately burn it.

### Deflationary Supply

Over time, constant burning reduces the total circulating supply.
