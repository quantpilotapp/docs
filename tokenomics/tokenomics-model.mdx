## Fee Conversion & the Burn Mechanism

### The Process

Whenever a user or business pays a fee in the QuantPilot ecosystem — be it in $SOL, $USDT, or $QP — the fee is routed to a decentralized exchange.

#### Automatic Swaps

The fee tokens are swapped for $QP at the current market price.

#### Complete Burn

Immediately after purchase, 75% of the $QP acquired from these fees is sent to a burn address, removing them from circulation forever.

#### Treasury Allocation

The remaining 25% of the $QP acquired from these fees is sent to the Treasury, which is managed by the QuantPilot DAO.

### Deflationary Pressure

Since 75% fee-related $QP is burned, each fee-paying transaction shrinks the available supply. Over time, as more people use the ecosystem, the supply is further reduced, making $QP inherently deflationary.
