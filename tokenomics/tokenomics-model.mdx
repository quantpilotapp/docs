<Warning>QuantPilot has not yet launched its token. The token launch is planned for Q1 2025.</Warning>

## Fee Conversion & the Burn Mechanism

### The Process

Whenever a user or business pays a fee in the QuantPilot ecosystem — be it in SOL, USDT, or QuantPilot's token — the fee is routed to a decentralized exchange.

#### Automatic Swaps

If the fee token is SOL or USDT, it is swapped to QuantPilot's token at the current market price.

#### Complete Burn

Immediately after purchase, 75% of the quantpilot's token acquired from these fees is sent to a burn address, removing them from circulation forever.

#### Treasury Allocation

The remaining 25% of the acquired QuantPilot token from these fees is sent to the Treasury, which is managed by the [QuantPilot DAO](https://docs.quantpilot.ai/dao/overview).

### Deflationary Pressure

Since 75% fee-related QP is burned, each fee-paying transaction shrinks the available supply. Over time, as more people use the ecosystem, the supply is further reduced, making QP inherently deflationary.
