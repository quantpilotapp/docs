## Business Model: API & App Mechanics

The QuantPilot ecosystem is designed to serve both enterprise-level (B2B) and consumer-facing (B2C) use cases. The common thread across both segments is the fee mechanism, which involves the automatic purchase and burning of QuantPilot's token, ensuring consistent deflationary pressure and long-term value appreciation.

Instead of traditional credit card or bank transactions, all fees are paid in tokens (e.g., SOL, USDT, QuantPilot's token).

### API (B2B) Mechanics

Enterprises, developers, and platforms seeking to leverage QuantPilot's agent APIs can do so by subscribing to one of our API plans. These plans are structured similarly to standard Web2 SaaS models—e.g., monthly subscription tiers, pay-per-use, or volume-based pricing.

### Applications (B2C) Mechanics

Individual user apps operate on a freemium model, subscription tiers, or usage-based fees.

Similar to conventional app marketplaces (e.g., monthly subscriptions or in-app purchases), users pay fees for premium features or additional services.

Each user interaction that requires payment — whether it's unlocking a feature or renewing a subscription — adds to the aggregate burn of QuantPilot's token. Over time, this continuous burn lowers the circulating supply.

### Unified Ecosystem Benefits

By applying the same buy-and-burn structure to both B2B and B2C segments, QuantPilot creates a consistent demand for QP while ensuring that each transaction contributes to the token's deflation. This unified model bridges the gap between traditional fee-based services and the crypto space, presenting a sustainable, long-term value proposition for all stakeholders—be they businesses, individual users, or token holders.
