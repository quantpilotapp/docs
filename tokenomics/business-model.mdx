<Warning>QuantPilot has not yet launched its token. The token launch is planned for Q1 2025.</Warning>

## Business Model: API & App Mechanics

The QuantPilot ecosystem is designed to serve both enterprise-level (B2B) and consumer-facing (B2C) use cases. The common thread across both segments is the fee mechanism, which involves the automatic purchase and burning of QuantPilot's token, ensuring consistent deflationary pressure and long-term value appreciation.

Instead of traditional credit card or bank transactions, all fees are paid in tokens (e.g., SOL, USDT, QuantPilot's token).

### API (B2B) Mechanics

Enterprises, developers, and platforms seeking to leverage QuantPilot's intelligence APIs can do so by simply using our services. The API calls are priced per-request.

### Terminal Application (B2C) Mechanics

Individual users can access QuantPilot via the Terminal Application. The terminal access has a free tier and holder-gated premium tiers.

### Unified Ecosystem Benefits

By applying the same buy-and-burn structure to both B2B and B2C segments, QuantPilot creates a consistent demand for QP while ensuring that each transaction contributes to the token's deflation. This unified model bridges the gap between traditional fee-based services and the crypto space, presenting a sustainable, long-term value proposition for all stakeholdersâ€”be they businesses, individual users, or token holders.
