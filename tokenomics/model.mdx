## Fee Conversion & the Burn Mechanism

### The Process

Whenever a user or business pays a fee in the QuantPilot ecosystem — be it in $SOL, $USDT, or $QP — the fee is routed to a decentralized exchange.

#### Automatic Swaps

The fee tokens are swapped for $QP at the current market price.

#### Complete Burn

Immediately after purchase, 75% of the $QP acquired from these fees is sent to a burn address, removing them from circulation forever.

#### Treasury Allocation

The remaining 25% of the $QP acquired from these fees is sent to the Treasury, which is managed by the QuantPilot DAO.

### Deflationary Pressure

Since 75% fee-related $QP is burned, each fee-paying transaction shrinks the available supply. Over time, as more people use the ecosystem, the supply is further reduced, making $QP inherently deflationary.

## Business Model: API & App Mechanics

The QuantPilot ecosystem is designed to serve both enterprise-level (B2B) and consumer-facing (B2C) use cases. The common thread across both segments is the fee mechanism, which involves the automatic purchase and burning of $QP, ensuring consistent deflationary pressure and long-term value appreciation.

### API (B2B) Mechanics

Enterprises, developers, and platforms seeking to leverage QuantPilot's agent APIs can do so by subscribing to one of our API plans. These plans are structured similarly to standard Web2 SaaS models—e.g., monthly subscription tiers, pay-per-use, or volume-based pricing.

Instead of traditional credit card or bank transactions, all fees are paid in tokens (e.g., SOL, USDT, $QP). Upon payment, the fee is automatically routed through a decentralized exchange, where it is swapped for $QP. Immediately after the $QP purchase, the tokens are burned.

### Applications (B2C) Mechanics

Individual user apps operate on a freemium model, subscription tiers, or usage-based fees.

Similar to conventional app marketplaces (e.g., monthly subscriptions or in-app purchases), users pay fees for premium features or additional services. The difference is that payment is made in crypto, which is then used to buy $QP.

Each user interaction that requires payment—whether it's unlocking a feature or renewing a subscription—adds to the aggregate burn of $QP. Over time, this continuous burn lowers the circulating supply.

### Unified Ecosystem Benefits

By applying the same buy-and-burn structure to both B2B and B2C segments, QuantPilot creates a consistent demand for $QP while ensuring that each transaction contributes to the token's deflation. This unified model bridges the gap between traditional fee-based services and the crypto space, presenting a sustainable, long-term value proposition for all stakeholders—be they businesses, individual users, or token holders.
