## The Problem

Current DeFi tools and AI agents struggle with **fragmented data**, high upkeep costs, and incomplete insights. Developers spend too much time integrating siloed information from blockchains, social media, code repositories, and more—time that could be spent innovating instead.

## The Vision

QuantPilot aims to be the **AI oracle for Web3**, aggregating data and intelligence into a single layer that dApps, specialized agents, and users can rely on. Our core goal: empower autonomous agents and human users alike with **seamless, real-time** intelligence, fostering a future where data-driven decisions are the norm.

## The Architecture

Our infrastructure is built around four pillars:

1. **Data Lake** - A single source of truth for market feeds, social sentiment, and on-chain metrics.
2. **AI Models** - Cutting-edge analytics for price forecasting, yield strategies, risk detection, and more.
3. **Low Latency Network** - A high-speed pipeline to detect and react to blockchain events as they happen.
4. **Agent Swarm** - A distributed set of specialized agents, each focusing on tasks like data gathering or trade execution.

## Tokenomics & DAO

QuantPilot uses a **buy-and-burn** model—every fee from our apps or API is swapped into our QP token, then partially burned. This drives **deflation** and aligns long-term incentives.

Governance is handled by a **DAO** that practices a fractal democracy model: contributions earn “respect,” and the most respected members form a council to guide treasury and strategic decisions.
