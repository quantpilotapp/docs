## Introduction

In the rapidly evolving world of Web3 AI agents, **specialization** is both an advantage and a necessity. Agents for yield farming, “pumpamental” analysis, security, celebrity engagements, and other niche tasks each need **different** slices of data to excel—price feeds, security intel, market sentiment, code repository details, team history, or even broader cultural context.

### Problem: Fragmented Data & High Overhead

- **Siloed Information**: Data remains scattered across Discord servers, GitHub repos, private databases, social media, on-chain, and more. Gathering the right context for each agent use-case often involves constructing and maintaining brittle data pipelines.

- **Expensive Infrastructure**: Constant upkeep of these pipelines drains resources, especially as data sources and endpoints shift. It’s **not feasible** for every dApp or agent to build and maintain their own specialized agents for every new challenge.

### Core challenge: answering a range of questions

Basic agentes/LLM systems are not able to forecast, find similarities, or do deep analysis.

Users want query the agent to:

- understand fanbase sentiment

  - "What is the sentiment and activity of $RAY community?"

- get to know price outlook

  - "What is the price outlook for the next week for $TRUMP?"

- find similar tokens

  - "I HODL $SIGMA, can you find me similar tokens?"

- get a risk index considering a range of variables

  - "Taking into consideration the risk index of my current holdings, please recommend other Solana DefAI projects to research."

To be able to answer these questions, the QuantPilot's foundational agents are provided access to a proprietary large data lake and proprietary AI models.

### Solution: QuantPilot

QuantPilot exists to be the **intelligence layer** for Web3 agents—a dedicated solution that manages the complexity of data integration and multi-agent orchestration.

By focusing on aggregating, parsing, and delivering **context-specific** data through a developer-friendly SDK and a chat-first interface, QuantPilot helps specialized agents and humans make decisions.

It removes the friction of building and maintaining sprawling, proprietary data pipelines for each unique agent scenario, accelerating the entire AI agent ecosystem and freeing developers to innovate.
