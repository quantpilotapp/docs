## Overview of QuantPilot's AI Models

QuantPilot leverages advanced machine learning (ML) models to deliver forward-looking analysis, clustering, and predictive insights. These AI-driven tools form a critical part of QuantPilot’s mission to provide actionable intelligence across the DeFi ecosystem.

### Clustering Models

Clustering algorithms identify similarities between tokens and projects, enabling QuantPilot to:

- Recommend relevant projects or tokens to users based on their preferences.
- Create personalized ETFs by grouping related tokens into curated sets.

### Forward-Looking Models

Forward-looking models are designed to anticipate future trends and optimize strategies:

- **Price Action Outlook**: Gain insights into potential price movements for better decision-making.
- **Yield Optimization**: Predict and proactively rebalance portfolios to maximize returns.

### Predictive Models

QuantPilot’s predictive models are tailored for enhanced security and risk mitigation:

- **Scam Detection**: Identify potential rug pulls by comparing ongoing projects to historical scam patterns. This involves analyzing hundreds of variables to predict the likelihood of malicious activity.

### Correlation Analysis Models

Correlation analysis helps uncover relationships between tokens and broader market trends:

- Detect how altcoins correlate with chain-native tokens (e.g., SOL, ETH) or Bitcoin.
- Use correlation strength as an additional indicator for understanding token price action.

QuantPilot’s AI models are continuously refined to provide users with reliable, actionable insights, making them a vital component of its intelligence layer.
