## What is a data lake?

A **data lake** is a large, centralized storage system where raw, structured, and unstructured data is stored in its original format. Unlike traditional databases, a data lake does not require predefined structures, making it flexible for storing diverse data types.

## How does QuantPilot use its data lake?

QuantPilot's data lake collects and stores data from diverse sources, including centralized exchanges, social media platforms like Twitter/X, blockchain data, project websites, and Telegram chats. Additionally, the lake integrates on-chain indicators, such as trading and holding activity metrics, wallet and fund distribution statistics, and custom datasets, including extensive lists of key opinion leaders (KOLs) and celebrities.

This robust data repository enables QuantPilot to provide real-time insights and comprehensive analysis, forming the backbone of its intelligence-driven solutions for the DeFi ecosystem.
