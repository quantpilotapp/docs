## 1. Overview

QuantPilot DAO will be established to govern the treasury in a transparent and decentralized manner. Inspired by fractal democracy, this approach encourages active, community-driven decision-making. Participants earn non-transferable reputation through periodic contribution assessments, ensuring that leadership roles are filled by those who consistently add value.

## 2. Treasury & Decision-Making

The DAO oversees how treasury funds are allocated (e.g., grants, community initiatives, and ecosystem growth). Each week, members take part in a "Respect Game":

### Contributions Presented

Participants summarize their recent work for QuantPilot.

### Peer Ranking

Small groups rank each participant's impact, generating transparent, on-chain reputation scores.

### Council Formation

The most respected contributors share multi-signature authority over the DAO's treasury and any strategic decisions.

### Executive Appointment

Acting as a board of directors, the council collectively elects a "CEO"-like figure who is tasked with driving day-to-day operations.

## 3. Use of Treasury Funds

### Server and Service Costs

Funding for infrastructure maintenance, hosting, and operational services to ensure platform stability and performance.

### Salaries

Compensation for core team members and contributors who maintain and develop the QuantPilot ecosystem.

### CEX Listings

Strategic allocation for securing listings on major centralized exchanges to increase token accessibility and liquidity.

### Marketing

Resources for community growth, brand awareness, and strategic partnerships to expand the QuantPilot ecosystem.

## 4. Access to Fractal Democracy Voting

In order to participate in the Respect Game (and thereby the fractal democracy voting system), at least three existing members must approve the pending member. This mechanism ensures that only genuine contributors join the process and helps maintain the integrity of the DAO.

## 5. Proposals & Council Decision-Making

Proposals within the DAO are decided by a council consisting of the 8 most recently respected members.

### Council Selection

Each member's "respect score" is averaged over the last twelve weeks to determine who makes it onto the council.

### Ongoing Rotation

After each weekly election, the average respect for all participants is recalculated.

## 6. Treasury Transactions

### Multi-Signature Execution

Once a proposal is agreed upon, 3 out of 4 council members (i.e., 75%) must sign the transaction for it to be executed on-chain.

## 7. Handling Bad Actors

Fractal democracy naturally mitigates bad actors:

### Earning Respect

Members must earn the community's trust and respect over time through meaningful contributions.

### Exclusion by Design

Bad actors will fail to gain the necessary respect and cannot obstruct progress.

## 8. Key Benefits

### Transparent Governance

All decisions, reputation points, and allocations are recorded on-chain.

### Fair Participation

Anyone contributing to QuantPilot can rise to a leadership role through community recognition.

### Adaptive & Sustainable

The rotating council structure reflects the community's evolving trust in members' contributions.
