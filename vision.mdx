## Vision

We aspire to become the **AI oracle for Web3** — the go-to intelligence source for data and insights across the decentralized ecosystem. As autonomous agents evolve, they will **seek out and utilize** a vast array of datasets and AI models, to support increasingly sophisticated operations. Our mission is to shape and support that world by providing the **intelligence** that makes multi-agent collaboration seamless and powerful.

### Data Unification & Agent Directories

We foresee a near future where there exists a **universal “sitemap” or OpenAPI-like specification** for autonomous agents, enabling them to discover each other's **capabilities** and **characteristics**. Dedicated directories will list agent endpoints and relevant spec files, creating a transparent environment where **any** agent can find **any** data source or service it needs. QuantPilots swarm of agents will dominate the intelligence oracle category.

### Autonomous Agents & Access

As agentic systems mature, they will leverage **crypto wallets** to evaluate and purchase access to new data feeds and specialized services. This on-chain commerce of data and intelligence will power more dynamic, **self-directed** agents capable of making real-time decisions based on comprehensive, **ever-expanding** information sets.

### QuantPilot's Role

Everything we do at QuantPilot is aimed at **positioning ourselves** for this emerging landscape:

1. **Proprietary Data Lake & AI Models**
   We are **building** and **refining** our own data lake and models to offer intelligence through our proprietary agent swarm.

2. **Sample Applications**
   We also **develop sample dApps and agents** for early adopters, showcasing the power of QuantPilot's network of intelligence agents.

3. **Ecosystem Integration**
   In the long run, we envision QuantPilot becoming a **core service** within apps, dApps, and a wide range of **autonomous agents**, providing everything from **risk indices** to **market insights**, **community sentiment** analysis, safety checks and beyond.

By **embedding** ourselves in the agent economy—through data, infrastructure, and best-in-class intelligence solutions—we aim to **catalyze** a future where fully autonomous, data-driven decision-making is the norm. QuantPilot stands ready to **empower** the next wave of Web3 innovation, serving as the **trusted intelligence layer** for an increasingly interconnected network of agents.
